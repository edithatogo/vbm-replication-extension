# Contributing to vbm-replication-extension

Contributions should make the vote-by-mail replication and extension easier to reproduce and assess. Preserve the README's explicit distinction between AI-generated research outputs and independently verified findings.

## Before you start

Read the [README](README.md), reproduction notes, and source-data documentation before changing an analysis. Keep original replication material separate from extension data and generated results. Explain changes to cohort definitions, outcome coding, or modelling assumptions.

Search existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating work. Describe substantial proposals before implementation, and use repository issue or pull request templates when available. Small corrections can go directly into a focused pull request.

For bug reports, include the affected version or commit, environment, minimal reproduction, expected and actual behavior, and sanitized diagnostics. For feature requests, explain the use case and intended outcome.

## Development and validation

The README documents this sequence from the repository's analysis workspace:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python code/02_replicate.py
python code/03_prepare_extension.py
python code/04_extension_analysis.py
```

Confirm required input files and paths before running it. Record the environment, source versions, command outputs, and relevant result comparisons. Reproduce affected tables and figures, and identify any deviations from the previous specification. Use independent numerical checks for estimation changes. Do not turn a successful script execution into a claim that an empirical finding is validated. Preserve original data terms, citation information, and known limitations such as proxy outcome coding and pre-trend concerns.

Update affected documentation and examples alongside behavior changes. Add a focused regression case for a bug fix where executable tests are appropriate. Record checks that were not run and the reason.

## Submitting a pull request

Create a focused branch from the current `main` branch and open a pull request back to it. Keep unrelated formatting, refactoring, and dependency changes separate.

Include:

- The problem, proposed change, and resulting behavior.
- Related issues or existing track references.
- Exact validation commands or inspection steps, results, and limitations.
- Compatibility implications and any data or dependency provenance.

Inspect the complete diff before submission. Required automated checks must pass before merge. Follow the existing repository and account policies; this guide does not introduce a second-person approval requirement or relax existing checks.

## Security and sensitive information

Follow the [account security policy](https://github.com/edithatogo/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md). Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** option if available. Otherwise request a private reporting contact without disclosing the vulnerability publicly. Keep credentials, personal data, and unredacted logs out of commits, issues, and examples.

## Licensing and conduct

Preserve existing attribution and applicable source or package terms. This guide does not grant a new license. Submit only material you are entitled to contribute, and document unclear permissions before adding third-party content. Follow the [account code of conduct](https://github.com/edithatogo/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This guide adds no CLA, mandatory sign-off, or relicensing condition.
